When the satellite is close to us and at night, the program sends a message to inform me of this so that i can see it at night.
by using API we import the requests package to take the lastes update information of ISS and take the position of satellite
and take my position then i check if the position is close to us we import smtplib to send email to inform the user to look to the ISS
of course at a specific time only at night by import datetime and check the time if is true.
